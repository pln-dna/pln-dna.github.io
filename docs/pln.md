# P-L-N Y-DNA Campaign

Research into the PELAN and PAYLING/PALING surnames, from Ulster and Nottinghamshire/Yorkshire respectively, found that they were in fact **the same patrilineal family**. There then followed a subsequent flurry of tracing people with possibly related names which resulted with much Y-DNA testing over a 15-year period:

 * PALING / PAYLING - Found mostly in Nottinghamshire, England
 * PELAN - originating from Lambeg / Lisburn in 17th century Ireland - most plausibly immigration from England
 * PELIN - found in Dublin, Ireland since the 18th century (but now almost died out)
 * PALIN - (Discovered 2024) likely been in the US since British colonial times - Province of Carolina - close match to Lisburn

Three variants from descendants of the Lisburn Pelans...

 * PALEN - North America
 * PELLING - Scotland
 * PALAN - North America

 For the purposes of the research, the two major 'Pelan' haplogroups are considered the same family as the Hancock-like is highly probable to be an NPE - given their proximity in time and place.
 
## Haplogroups

 * [R-BY104277](https://discover.familytreedna.com/y-dna/R-BY104277/tree) - so far, everyone downstream of this has a 'P-L-N' style name.
 
## What next ?

 There is an untested group in Ireland with limited genealogy:

  * PELIN - Co. Kildare / Co. Offaly

 There are North Americans with Irish origins with surnames like:

  * PELLING
  * PEELING

 There are plenty of similar names all over England

  * PELING
  * PELLING
  * PEELING
  * PALIN

## Genealogies ?

You can find much of the output of this work on Wikitree.

There is a target list of genealogies that should be Y-DNA tested:

  * [Uncertain Pelan - Ireland](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Category:Uncertain%2C_Pelan_Name_Study)
  * [Uncertain Paling - England](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Category:Uncertain%2C_Paling_Name_Study)

## Thank-you

I would like to thank everyone who has been tested or who has agreed to be tested. Without you this knowledge would never have been revealed. Our small, isolated groups of rare names actually constitutes a much larger patrilineal group. With more testing in France and 
The Netherlands, there is a possibility of further ancient connections outside the British Isles.
