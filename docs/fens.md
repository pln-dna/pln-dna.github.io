# Fenland Y-DNA Project

![Logo](img/fenland-banner-1.png){ width="300" align="center" }

This project seeks to drive the uptake of Y-DNA testing amongst the current male population of the English Fens. It will do so through publicity with the various family and local history groups - with an additional hope of being able to sponsor selected testees. The aim is to direct potential candidates to the appropriate project administrators (Surname and/or Geographical) where funds may be available.

## Candidates

You need to be:

 * A biological male (i.e. have a Y-chromosome) 
 * Bear a patrilineal surname, i.e. the same surname as your father, his father etc.
 * You should have paternal line ancestry from the English Fenlands, which appears on any 19th century census record.
 * If you or any of your paternal line are known or suspected to be adopted this needs to be factored in. 
 * Funding may require additional criteria according to the relevant project administrator
